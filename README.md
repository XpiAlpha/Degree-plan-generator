# Degree-plan-generator
degree plan generator for Texas Wesleyan University students

We (Murtaza, Abdullah, and Tareq) decided to focus on a degree plan calculator for Texas Wesleyan University. Since we as a student struggled understanding the “Degree Audit” on Ram link. It takes significant effort by students to figure out what course they need and what are the prerequisites for the course. The other problem is that it does calculate what year you want to graduate. 
Considering the above problem we decided to create a web application, using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP) which helps students better understand their degree plan and calculate the amount of time they want to graduate in. For instance some students want to graduate sooner. Based on algorithms in the backend we calculate when the classes are offered, and what might be the possibility that student can graduate at the mentioned amount of time. We probably add some other feature by recommending them taking classes in colleges or universities nearby.
